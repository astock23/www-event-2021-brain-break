**Brain Break Attendance Details**
  
Brain Break events are held via the Zoom Platform. Prior to attending a Brain Break event, registered attendees will receive a link to access the event at least three hours prior to event start time. 

Attendees will join and participate in a 15 minute Sponsor Discover Demo, then be moved into the Feature Program Webinar space. 
  
To join us for a Brain Break, be sure to register in advance.
